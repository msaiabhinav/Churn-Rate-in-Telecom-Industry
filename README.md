# Telecom Customer Churn Prediction

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting customer churn in the telecom industry using multiple machine learning models. The objective is to identify customers at high risk of churn and understand the key factors driving churn behavior to support data-driven retention strategies.

A detailed end-to-end analysis is documented in the final project report included in this repository.

## Business Objective
- Predict whether a customer will churn
- Identify key churn drivers
- Enable proactive customer retention strategies

## Models Used
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Boosted Tree
- Bootstrap Forest
- Neural Network
- Naive Bayes

Models were evaluated using validation AUC to ensure strong generalization.

## Key Insights
- Longer customer tenure significantly reduces churn
- Month-to-month contracts increase churn risk by 3–4x
- Higher monthly charges increase churn probability
- Service bundling reduces churn
- Automatic payment methods lower churn risk

## Model Performance
- Best validation AUC achieved: ~0.84
- Ensemble and neural network models performed best
- Minimal overfitting observed across models

## Tools Used
- JMP Pro
- Predictive modeling (regression, trees, ensembles)
- ROC and AUC-based evaluation
